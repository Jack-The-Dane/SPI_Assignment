WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net assignment_3_i/SPI_sub/inst/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin assignment_3_i/SPI_sub/inst/transmission_done_INST_0/O, cell assignment_3_i/SPI_sub/inst/transmission_done_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net assignment_3_i/SPI_sub/inst/MISO_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin assignment_3_i/SPI_sub/inst/MISO_reg_i_2/O, cell assignment_3_i/SPI_sub/inst/MISO_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT assignment_3_i/SPI_sub/inst/transmission_done_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
assignment_3_i/latch_1_0/inst/Q_reg
WARNING: [DRC ZPS7-1] PS7 block required: The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
